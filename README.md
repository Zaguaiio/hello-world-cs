All the work here was done using Visual Studio Code, it required dotnet sdk 5.0
Created project using a normal console with:
    dotnet new console
Built project using a normal console with:
    dotnet buid
Ran project using a normal console with:
    dotnet run

I was able to run the project on a normal console running the exe under:
